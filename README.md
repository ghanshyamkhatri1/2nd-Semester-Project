# Faculty Management System
This project is developed as part of our **second semester end-semester project**, using the Qt Framework with C++ and SQLite. It is a Faculty Management System that supports adding, updating, and deleting faculty records, managing routines, and allowing faculty to take student attendance through a simple and user-friendly interface. All data is securely stored in SQLite.
